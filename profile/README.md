## Hi there 👋, Welcome to the Twin Cities Open Source Developers group!

This organization was created to foster connection within the tech community in the Twin Cities area. With that said, all are welcome to contribute and be a part of this community! 

Behind this is a [Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/twin-cities-open-source-developers/) where individuals from the Twin Cities can come together to collaborate, learn, and build together.
